# 📘 Java OOP Practice Exercises (Arrays Only)

This repository contains multiple Java practice exercises focused on:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Arrays (No ArrayList)
- Data analysis using loops
- Real-world inspired mini systems

All tasks are implemented using only arrays.
No static utility methods are used except `main()`.
